# Sync with GitHub

Amplication can push the code of your app to a GitHub repository. It will provide you with full control on your app, and will also allow you to easily track the changes and the code generated by Amplication.

## General

- For every commit you create in Amplication, it will push a new Pull Request to your GitHub repository with the updated code.
- You will always have the choice to decide how and if to merge the changes to your branch.
- The pull request will be created in a new branch, with the default branch of your repository (usually **master** or **main**) as a base.
- The code from Amplication will be created relatively to the root of the selected repository.
- The selected repository must not be empty, so please create at least one file in the root folder.

If you want to create a new repository in GitHub, you can do so [here](https://github.com/new). Please select **Initialize this repository with a README file** to make sure the new repository is not empty.

If you are hosting a local Amplication server, you should first follow [this guide](/docs/connect-server-to-github) in order to configure the Server to work with a new GitHub application.
